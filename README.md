# INCOMPLETE VERSION -- PyFrechet

'/frechetForCurves/PyFrechet' is a Python API package

## Description

The API is designed to make use of Dr. Wenks Frechet programs. Dr. Wenks
Frechet and WFrechet programs were initially written in C and used command
lines and print statements to create a user interface.

This active program interface takes a modified version of the two C programs
and wraps them using CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface) API In-Line.

The .so (shares object) libraries generated by CFFI are used to create the pure
Python API package. The plan for this API is to be able to:

  * Check if a continuous path on both curves exists for epsilon (using
    Frechet Distance and Weak Frechet Distance)
  * One or two epsilon optimization algos (using Frechet Distance and Weak
    Frechet Distance)
  * Visualizing the free space for epsilon (using Frechet Distance)

### Documentations
  All detailed Documentation is going to be generated using Doxygen located in
  '/docs.'

  Overall tutorials of how to use the basic program will be written in this
  README.me.

### Dependencies

* To rebuild the portion of code written in C, You will have to run
  '/source/cffi/build.py' and install CFFI 1.7.0. This will deploy the new code
  to the Python API package.  

* The visualization engine will run using GeoPandas. This will have to be
  installed however I can probably find a way to have this installed to python3
  non-native library automatically.

### Executing program

These are some examples of how the Python API could be used.
```
from PyFrechet.distance import StrongDistance, WeakDistance
from PyFrechet.optimization import binarysearch
from PyFrechet.visualization import FreeSpace

sd = StrongDistance.load_curves(curve_1=filename.txt, curve_2=filename.txt)

iRT = sd.isReachableTable(epsilon=100)
print(bool(iRT))

eps = BinarySearch.epsilon(sd, precision=0.1)
print(eps)

FreeSpace.visualize(sd)
```
